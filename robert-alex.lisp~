;;;; ASSIGNMENT 5
;;;;
;;;; Connect-Four Player
;;;; Due Midnight, the evening of WEDNESDAY, APRIL 28.
;;;;
;;;;
;;;; You will provide the TA a single file (a revised version of this one).
;;;; You'll write the heuristic board evaluation function and the alpha-beta searcher
;;;; for a CONNECT FOUR game.  If you don't know how to play connect four, and can't
;;;; find stuff online, get ahold of me.  The version of connect four we'll be playing
;;;; is NON-TOROIDAL (non-"wraparound").
;;;;
;;;;
;;;;
;;;; HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE FILE
;;;;
;;;; This is the file you will fill out and provide to the TA.  It contains your project-specific
;;;; code.  Don't bother providing the connectfour.lisp file -- we have it, thanks.
;;;;
;;;; I'm providing you with one function the MAKE-COMPUTER-MOVE function.  This function 
;;;; takes a game state and generates all one-move-away states from there.  It then calls 
;;;; ALPHA-BETA on those states returns the new game state which got the highest alpha-beta 
;;;; score.  Piece of cake.
;;;;
;;;; You will write:
;;;;
;;;; 1. The ALPHA-BETA function.  This is a straightforward implementation of the
;;;;    function described in the lecture notes.  However to make your player better
;;;;    you MIGHT (or might not! -- it could make things worse) sort the expanded children
;;;;    based on who's best, so as to increase the chance that alpha-beta will cut off
;;;;    children early and improve your search time.  Look into the SORT function.
;;;;
;;;; 2. The EVALUATE function.  Or more specifically, you'll fill out one part of
;;;;    it (the progn block shown).  Here you'll provide an intelligent heuristic
;;;;    evaluator.  Right now the evaluator provided ("0") literally says that
;;;;    all unfinished games are draws.  That's pretty stupid -- surely you can
;;;;    do better than that!  You're welcome, and perhaps encouraged, to write your
;;;;    own separate function(s) and call it from within the EVALUATE function so as
;;;;    to keep the EVALUATE function code clean.  Keep whatever functions and
;;;;    auxillary code to within this file please.
;;;;
;;;; Your code should work for any width or height board, and for any number of
;;;; checkers in a row to win (at least 2).  These values can be extracted from
;;;; game board functions in the connectfour.lisp file.  Indeed, I'd strongly suggest
;;;; examining all of that file as it may contain some valuable functions and constants
;;;; that you might want to know about.
;;;;
;;;; Your code will not only be in this file but will be in its own package as well.
;;;; Your package name will be :firstname-lastname
;;;; For example, the package name for MY package is called :sean-luke
;;;; will change the text :TEMPLATE with your :firstname-lastname package name
;;;; in the TWO places it appears in this file.
;;;;
;;;; You will then name your file "firstname-lastname.lisp".  For example, I would
;;;; name my own file "sean-luke.lisp"
;;;;
;;;;
;;;; RUNNING THE CODE
;;;;
;;;; You'll want to compile your code first, like I do to my code in this example:
;;;;
;;;; (load "connectfour")
;;;; (compile-file "connectfour.lisp")
;;;; (load "connectfour")
;;;; (load "sean-luke")
;;;; (compile-file "sean-luke.lisp")
;;;; (load "sean-luke")
;;;;
;;;; Now we're ready to go.  If you want to just do a quick human-human game, you
;;;; don't need to compile and load your own file, just the connectfour file.
;;;;
;;;; You can run a simple human-against-human example like this:
;;;;
;;;; (play-human-human-game)
;;;;
;;;; You can run a simple human-against-computer example like this (replace sean-luke
;;;; with your own package name in this example of course)
;;;;
;;;; (play-human-computer-game #'sean-luke:make-computer-move t)  
;;;;
;;;; ...or if you wish the computer to go first,
;;;;
;;;; (play-human-computer-game #'sean-luke:make-computer-move nil)
;;;;
;;;; You can play a head-to-head game against two computer players (loading both of course)
;;;; like this:
;;;;
;;;; (play-game #'sean-luke:make-computer-move #'keith-sullivan:make-computer-move)
;;;;
;;;; Note that for all three of these functions (play-human-human-game, play-human-computer-game,
;;;; play-game) there are lots of optional keywords to change the width o the board, the height,
;;;; the number in a row that must be achieved, the search depth, whether boards are printed, etc.
;;;;
;;;;
;;;;
;;;; TESTING POLICY
;;;;
;;;; Plagiarism rules still apply (no code given, no code borrowed from anyone or any source
;;;; except the TA and the Professor, do not lay eyes on other people's code anywhere, including
;;;; online).  However they are softened in the following fashion:
;;;;
;;;;    - You are strongly encouraged to play against each other as long as neither of you
;;;;      looks at each others' code nor discusses your alpha-beta code.  Go on the forum and
;;;;      ask for partners.
;;;;
;;;;    - You are NOT permitted to discuss, in any way, the ALPHA-BETA function with anyone
;;;;      except ME and the TA.  That has to be done entirely on your own. 
;;;;
;;;;    - You ARE allowed to discuss, in general and HIGHLY ABSTRACT terms, your own approach
;;;;      to the EVALUATE function.  You are not allowed to show code or read another student's
;;;;      code.  But you can talk about your theory and general approach to doing board evaluation
;;;;      for connect four.  Let a thousand heuristics bloom!  You are also welcome to
;;;;      go online and get ideas about how to do the EVALUATE function as long as you do NOT
;;;;      read code.  I'm just as good as the next person -- perhaps even better -- at gathering
;;;;      every scrap of connect four code on the web and comparing your code against it.
;;;;
;;;; OTHER POLICIES
;;;;
;;;; - This code may have, and almost certainly has, bugs.  I'll post revisions as needed.
;;;;
;;;; - Near the end of the exam we will have a single-elimination tournament competition.
;;;;      The winner of the competition gets to play against the professor's "better" evaluator
;;;;      (assuming I've written one by then) and ALSO receives an improvement in his overall
;;;;      course grade.  Runners up may receive something smaller: at least a candy bar, perhaps
;;;;      a better incentive.
;;;;
;;;; - If your evaluator is too slow, you will be penalized with a cut in your search depth.
;;;;   Thus it's in your best interest to have as good an evaluator/depth combination as possible.
;;;;   Note that it's often the case that evaluators that are good on ODD depths are bad on EVEN
;;;;   depths (or vice versa!).  I won't say what depth will be used in the tournament.
;;;;
;;;; - To make your code run as fast as possible, I strongly suggest you look into Lisp compiler optimization.  SBCL's profiler might prove helpful too.
;;;;
;;;; Good luck!
